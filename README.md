### Raphael Shirley

I am an astronomer at the University of Southampton. I work on various software packages in astronomy. You can see some more information about me on my personal website:

The main things I am working on now are pipelines for joint processing of upcoming [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/) imaging and near infrared imaging from the [VISTA telescope](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/).
